These numbers are highly depends on the environments, the number of possible angles and position of the target. The larger nodes in a layer the higher capacity to learn but slower to converge. It is essential to find the optimal number of nodes which is capable of solving the environment with the fastest time. If training score oscilates, the number of nodes needs to be increased as there is not enough room to store learning. If it grows too slow, the number of nodes need to be reduced as it is hard to fill."

    "The picture below shows how the Multi Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (MADDPG) was trained with between 1000 to 1050 episodes, around 1030 episodes\n",
    "The learning algorithms were not finding the policies to score positively early training session. Once agents knows which actions in specific states yields higher rewards, it starts to converge to the policies rather exponentially.\n",
    "The stable learning after the score of 0.25 shows that the chosen set of hyper parameters are adequate for this environment. However, this stability can be increased by using priortised experience replay or Generalized Advantage Estimation.\n",
    "OUN noise played an important role in exploration in early training stages, from 0 to 6 episodes. The effect of exploration were recorded as oscilation of score during the stage. After enough exploration, the agents could learn the envionment exponentially.\n",

    "This DDPG can be augmented with:\n",
