These numbers are highly depends on the environments, the number of possible angles and position of the target. The larger nodes in a layer the higher capacity to learn but slower to converge. It is essential to find the optimal number of nodes which is capable of solving the environment with the fastest time. If training score oscilates, the number of nodes needs to be increased as there is not enough room to store learning. If it grows too slow, the number of nodes need to be reduced as it is hard to fill."

    "#### 1. Discussion on the result plot\n",
    "The picture below shows how the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG) was trained with in 2000 episodes? (2100 - 100) episodes, More realistically, the episode with an average score of more than 30 starts from 1450 episodes. The learning algorithms were not finding the policies to score positively early training session. Once agents knows which actions in specific states yields higher rewards, it starts to converge to the policies rather exponentially.\n",
    "The stable learning after the score of 0.25 shows that the chosen set of hyper parameters are adequate for this environment. However, this stability can be increased by using priortised experience replay or Generalized Advantage Estimation.\n",

    "### 6. Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "This DDPG can be augmented with:\n",
    "- GAE (Generalized Advantage Estimation) : more generalised Advantage estimation\n",
    "- PER (Priority Experience Replay) : more efficient use of Replay buffer\n",
    "\n",
    "Other architectural methods can be applied to solve the environment:\n",
