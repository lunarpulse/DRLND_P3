    "##### MADPG\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I applied MADDPG (Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients) to solve a 2-agent Tennis game (Unity Tennis environment). DDPG is one of the most basic forms of deep reinforcement learning agent for solving continuous control problems. By using deterministic policy, policy gradients with respect to the value function is computable. Therefore, DDPG algorithm replaces such policy in DQN and re-formulate it as an actor-critic style learning algorithms where Q-function is learned using deep-Q learning and policy learning part uses the aforementioned gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "In MADDPG paper, the authors develop some tricks to apply DDPG in multi-agent setting. The most notorious problem in multi-agent control problem is that the environment is not a MDP anymore if any policy in the system is changed. Such problem will lead to great confusion (e.g. contradictory gradients for competing agents) during learning. One major trick here is that if the actions of all agents are given, then it will be a MDP again. To utilize this property, one can represent centralized value functions that takes into account all states/actions from all agents. Then, one can train a multi-agent system with all agents having a centralized critic and (local) policy. Since MADDPG does not assume specific multi-agent setting, it has been shown to perform well in competitive, cooperative and mixed scenarios.\n",
